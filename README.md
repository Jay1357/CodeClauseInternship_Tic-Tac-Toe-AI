Simple Tic Tac Toe AI.

This is a simple implementation of Tic Tac Toe with an AI opponent. The AI uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best moves to make.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Installation

Clone the repository:

Features
Simple command-line interface.
Minimax algorithm for AI opponent.
Basic error handling for invalid inputs.

How the AI Works
The AI uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best move to make in each turn. It recursively explores all possible future game states, assigning a score to each based on whether the outcome is a win, loss, or draw. The AI then selects the move with the highest score when it's its turn.
